### Principal Investigator

**Kai Chen, Ph.D.**  
Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania (starting January 2026)

Dr. Kai Chenâ€™s research integrates chemical biology, protein engineering, and genome editing to create molecular tools and delivery platforms for understanding biological systems and advancing therapeutic applications. As a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, he worked with Prof. Jennifer Doudna (2020 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry) to engineer CRISPR-Cas systems and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vehicles for precise, tissue-specific genome editing in vivo. During his Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology with Prof. Frances Arnold (2018 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry), he applied directed evolution to expand the catalytic repertoire of natural enzymes and repurpose their functions for biosynthetic applications. At Penn, the Chen Lab will combine chemical biology, molecular biology, biomolecular engineering, and genome editing to investigate protein and gene function and to develop next-generation biomolecular therapeutics.
