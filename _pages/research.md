We develop **protein engineering**, **genome editing**, **epigenetic regulation**, and **molecular delivery** technologies that span chemical biology, molecular biology, cell biology, bioengineering, and therapeutics. Our goal is to enable **next-generation molecular therapies** for human health.

## Protein engineering and directed evolution
We develop context-specific directed evolution platforms that are tailored to the intended application. Targets include but are not limited to gene-editing enzymes, sequence-specific proteases, and gene-regulatory proteins.

## Nanoparticle-based targeted delivery of therapeutic biomolecules
We design and build nanoparticle platforms for tissue-targeted delivery of therapeutic biomolecules, exemplified by CRISPR gene-editing enzymes. We are tackling delivery to the liver and lung,  with the brain and heart as more challenging targets.

## Epigenetic regulation and functional genomic studies
We repurpose nucleic acidâ€“modifying enzymes for targeted epigenetic editing and gene regulation, and create molecular tools to enable functional genomic studies and understand gene activities during disease development.

*We welcome collaborations on protein engineering, genome editing, and therapeutic delivery.*
